# Lanchat - an insecure (W)LAN messenger

It's like anaolgue radio, there's a bunch of channels and anybody can tune in.
Just choose your channel (a port in this case) and start sending and receiving
messages. Please keep in mind that this is totally insecure and everybody on
the same local network can read anything you send across the wire.

Run the UI:

    ./gradlew lanchat-compose:run
